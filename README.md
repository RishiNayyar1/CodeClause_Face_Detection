# CodeClause_Face_Detection
Face-Detection is a web application that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to detect faces in images in real-time. The project uses the  power of machine learning and computer vision techniques to provide an intuitive and interactive user experience for face detection.

# FEATURES of this project are: 
Face Detection: The project incorporates cutting-edge computer vision algorithms to identify and highlight faces within uploaded images. It uses JavaScript libraries like OpenCV.js or Face-API.js to perform accurate and real-time face detection.

Facial Expressions: With this project, users can gain insights into the emotions conveyed by the detected faces. By employing machine learning techniques, the application can analyze facial expressions, including happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. It provides an intuitive graphical representation of these emotions, allowing users to understand the underlying sentiment.

Face Landmarks: The project goes beyond basic face detection by utilizing advanced techniques to identify specific facial landmarks. By employing sophisticated algorithms, it accurately detects facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and eyebrows. Users can visualize these landmarks on the uploaded images, providing a detailed analysis of facial structure.

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Implementation: The project is implemented using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly web application. HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances the visual appeal with custom styling, and JavaScript powers the underlying functionality, making the project interactive and dynamic.
